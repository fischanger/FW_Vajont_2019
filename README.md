This repository collects all the files for the ERT Fullwaver geophysical survey held on 6 and 7 May 2019 at the site of the large Vajont
landslide.
The research project is directed by **Professor Roberto Francese (University of Parma and OGS)**.

Files in this repository are organized as follows:

- the **field_dataéé folder contains the ERT resistivity and chargeability datasets acquired by using the IRIS Instruments Fullwaver system 
  and a VIP5000 transmitter. In the **raw **directory are collected the raw files acquired by the fullwaver boxes, divided by the two acquisition days. The bin file contains the measures subjected to pre-processing and ready for processing.
- the DTM folder contains the digital terrain file xyz with 2x2m mesh of the area of ​​interest of the survey
- the processing folder contains the data file with configuration for
- in the topo_survey folder there are the kml files with the sensor positions following the staking and with the definitive coordinates of the receiving and transmission electrodes in the Gauss Boaga coordinate system.
